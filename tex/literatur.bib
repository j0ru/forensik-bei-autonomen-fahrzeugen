  abstract = {Smart cities are comprised of diverse and interconnected components constantly exchanging data and facilitating improved living for a nation's population. Our view of a typical smart city consists of four key components, namely, Smart Grids, Building Automation Systems (BAS), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), Smart Vehicles; with enabling Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and the Cloud platform. The adversarial threats and criminal misuses in a smart city are increasingly heterogenous and significant, with provisioning of resilient and end-to-end security being a daunting task. When a cyber incident involving critical components of the smart city infrastructure occurs, appropriate measures can be taken to identify and enumerate concrete evidence to facilitate the forensic investigation process. Forensic preparedness and lessons learned from past forensic analysis can help protect the smart city against future incidents. This paper presents a holistic view of the security landscape of a smart city, identifying security threats and providing deep insight into digital investigation in the context of the smart city.},

  abstract = {In the past years, software became an essential topic in modern vehicles, e.g., with the rise of more and more complex driver assistance systems. The advent of automated driving will drive this trend even further. Today, accident investigation, as well as warranty claim analysis, need to take into consideration an analysis of the rapidly increasing proportion of software and security based implementations as part of modern vehicles, the so-called digital forensics. This paper evaluates the general feasibility of digital forensics on a state-of-the-art vehicle. To do so, we analyzed current digital forensics techniques on a state-of-the-art vehicle to constitute gaps in the automotive forensics process used on in-vehicle systems. We present a general process for automotive forensics to close existing gaps and implemented it on a state-of-the-art vehicle in an in-vehicle device manipulation scenario. The implementation uses the on-board diagnostics interface, the diagnostics over internet protocol, as well as the unified diagnostic services for communication. Our implementation requires automotive Ethernet at the diagnostic interface. Our research shows future directions for efficient automotive forensic as well as the exemplary feasibility of automotive forensic analysis on state-of-the-art vehicles without the need for additional in-vehicle components such as intrusion detection systems or event data recorders.},

  abstract = {As technology has evolved, cities have become increasingly smart. Smart mobility is a crucial element in smart cities, and autonomous vehicles are an essential part of smart mobility. However, vulnerabilities in autonomous vehicles can be damaging to quality of life and human safety. For this reason, many security researchers have studied attacks and defenses for autonomous vehicles. However, there has not been systematic research on attacks and defenses for autonomous vehicles. In this survey, we analyzed previously conducted attack and defense studies described in 151 papers from 2008 to 2019 for a systematic and comprehensive investigation of autonomous vehicles. We classified autonomous attacks into the three categories of autonomous control system, autonomous driving systems components, and vehicle-to-everything communications. Defense against such attacks was classified into security architecture, intrusion detection, and anomaly detection. Due to the development of big data and communication technologies, techniques for detecting abnormalities using artificial intelligence and machine learning are gradually being developed. Lastly, we provide implications based on our systemic survey that future research on autonomous attacks and defenses is strongly combined with artificial intelligence and major component of smart cities.},

With the increasing complexity of automotive software, as for example in the case of drive-by-wire, automated driving and driver assitents, software correctness becomes more and more a crucial issue. In order that these innovations can become reality, it is necessary to be able to guarantee software correctness.The presented work aims at verification of automotive software. For this purpose it introduces a verification approach, including a framework of verified modules which assists the verification of the actual application. Feasibility of this approach was validated on a case study that also showed how verification can be integrated into the development process.},

  abstract  = {Recently, researchers have demonstrated how the lack of security features in road vehicles may allow adversaries to take over partial or even full control. Specifically, in-vehicle communication protocols are prone to attacks, because no security mechanisms have been developed for them. For a long time, they have been optimized only towards safety, in order to guarantee a high degree of reliability, robustness and real-time behavior. In this work, we focus on FlexRay, an automotive communication protocol whose core properties are strong determinism and high fault-tolerance for safety-critical applications. We propose to leverage the distinct safety-tailored features of FlexRay for security purposes, such as authentication. In particular, we demonstrate that the optional dualchannel mode can be used to provide authentication for FlexRay in a backward compatible manner. Additionally, we suggest different ways of transmitting the relevant message authentication codes over FlexRay. Finally, we propose a number of techniques for managing cryptographic keys, i.e. we associate these keys with FlexRay time slots and we use hash chains to derive new keys at low cost at runtime. In this way, we offer multiple security solutions for the FlexRay protocol, while trying to keep the overhead low.},
